## Key Features to Include in Your E-commerce Website

- **Navigation & Routing:** Use React Router for smooth navigation between pages like Home, Products, Cart, etc.
- **Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS is great for responsive layouts, so make sure your design adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **State Management:** Use React's useState or libraries like Redux to manage the state of the cart, user authentication, etc.
- **Mock API Calls:** Use the Fake Store API to mock product data fetching. For example, use axios or fetch to get product data, and manage the data in the React state.
- **Authentication (Optional):** If you plan to allow users to log in, you can mock the login process or use libraries like Firebase, Auth0, or create your own authentication system.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling (e.g., if the API call fails) to provide feedback to the user.
- **Animations & Transitions:** Use libraries like framer-motion or Tailwind CSS's built-in utilities for smooth animations, such as on hover or adding items to the cart.
